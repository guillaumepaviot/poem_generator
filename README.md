This is a low level implementation of NLP models to learn more about them. I use PyTorch to train different algorithms on Les Fleurs du Mal written by French poet Charles Baudelaire.

Current language model neural nets implemented:

- Bigram (with one, two character or one word as input)
- Bag of Words
- MLP, along the lines of [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) (with both characters or word as input)
